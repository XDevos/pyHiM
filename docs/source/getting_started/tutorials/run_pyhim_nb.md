# Jupyter notebook tutorial

A jupyter notebook is an interactive file where you can find both markdown text and executable code with its outputs dispayed.

To run by yourself the pyHiM tutorial, follow these steps:

1. Activate your conda environment for pyHiM

2. Install a tool to manage jupyter notebook like [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/install#jupyterlab)

3. We recommend you also run the following commands:

```
conda install ipykernel matplotlib
ipython kernel install --user --name=pyHiM-kernel
```

Once you spin up a jupyter lab from the `base` environment, select the `pyHiM-kernel` to be able to run *pyHiM* functions.


4. Open pyHiM tutorial with jupyter notebook:
```jupyter-lab```
