# Quickstart !

**Welcome to pyhiM !**

In context of structural biochemistry, pyHiM software provides the **processing** of **multiplexed FISH data** produced with HiM protocol and **visualization** tools.

Basic concept of this software is to **determine 3D position** of fluorescent spots, like DNA loci or RNA, in FISH images. These coordinates will be associated with their corresponding cell in order to analyze them.
